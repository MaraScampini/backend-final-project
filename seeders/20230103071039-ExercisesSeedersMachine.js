Step forward in front of an imaginary straight line between both pulleys while pulling your arms together in front of you. Your torso should have a small forward bend from the waist. This will be your starting position. With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, extend your arms to the side (straight out at both sides) in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms and torso should remain stationary; the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint. Return your arms back to the starting position as you breathe out. Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights. Hold for a second at the starting position and repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.",

Not all elliptical trainers have moveable arms, but if they do - use them to work your back and upper-body. To make it harder, increase the resistance. These are typically expressed as up or down arrows on the console. At first, introduce resistance slowly so you can get into a good rhythm. Keep pulling and pedalling, for as long as you want.
